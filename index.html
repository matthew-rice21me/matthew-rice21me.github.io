        </center>
        <center>
    <p>My name is Matthew Rice and i am from Coventry Rhode Island. I am currently attending the University of Rhode Island and i am majoring in computer science. The reason why i picked computer science as my major is because i want to be able to create things that i made using code which allows me to problem solve and use critical thinking. I have very little coding experience so having this website show my progress from where i came from will definitely motivate me to keep working harder. I went to Bishop Hendricken Highschool which is an all boy catholic highschool in Warick RI. I was in the National English Honor Society my senior of highschool. I would describe myself as motivated, passionate, and hard working.</p>

         <p>In my free time i like to hang out with my friends and go on walks or play tennis. I also love to ride my bike on the bike trail and watch the sunset. One of my obsessions for the past two years is watching anime. I absolutely love Jojo's Bizzare Adventure and One Piece which i am currently caught up with. I have four cats and a dog. My dog is a pure breed German Shepherd whom i absolutely love. Music is something that i am constantly listening to. Some of my favorite artist are Nirvanna, The Beatles, and Tyler the Creator.</p>

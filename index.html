       <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Matthew Rice and i am from Coventry Rhode Island. I am currently attending the University of Rhode Island and i am majoring in computer science. The reason why i picked computer science as my major is because i want to be able to create things that i made using code which allows me to problem solve and use critical thinking. I have very little coding experience so having this website show my progress from where i came from will definitely motivate me to keep working harder. I went to Bishop Hendricken Highschool which is an all boy catholic highschool in Warick RI. I was in the National English Honor Society my senior of highschool. I would describe myself as motivated, passionate, and hard working.</p>

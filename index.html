       <h1>About Me</h1>
        </center>
        <center>
    <p>My name is Matthew Rice and I am from Coventry, Rhode Island. I am currently attending the University of Rhode Island and I am majoring in computer science. The reason why I picked computer science as my major is because I want to be able to create things that I made using code which allows me to problem solve and use critical thinking. I have very little coding experience so having this website will show my progress from where i came from, and will definitely motivate me to keep working harder. I went to Bishop Hendricken Highschool which is an all boy catholic high school in Warick RI. I was in the National English Honor Society my senior of high school. I would describe myself as motivated, passionate, and hard working.</p>

        <center>
         <p>In my free time I like to hang out with my friends and go on walks or play tennis. I also love to ride my bike on the bike trail and watch the sunset. One of my obsessions for the past two years is watching anime. I absolutely love Jojo's Bizzare Adventure and One Piece which I am currently caught up with. I have four cats and a dog. My dog is a pure breed German Shepherd whom I absolutely love. Music is something that I am constantly listening to. Some of my favorite artist are Nirvanna, The Beatles, and Tyler the Creator.</p>
